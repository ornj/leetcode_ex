# LeetcodeEx

Learning me some Elixir by attempting Leetcode problems

## Process

Problems will be solved in their own modules. All problems will have tests to verify the solution at the very least satisfies the example given in the problem.

## Running Tests

Tests are run with `mix test`. Check `mix help test` for more information.

## Code Quality

Code quality is checked with [Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo). Enforcing a certain level of quality from the get-go will help me learn to do things "the right way".
